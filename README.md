## Projects
### **Tic-Tac-Toe game with MiniMax algorithm**
#### **Description:**
This project implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe where the user can play against another player or a computer. The computer uses the MiniMax algorithm to make the most optimal plays on a current game state. This project was made as my starting point in taking interest on logic and AI!

#### **Features:**
- **Game Modes:** Play against another player or a computer. Computer Vs Computer mode was also implemented.
- **Artifical Intelligence:** The computer uses the MiniMax algorithm to make the most optimal plays.
- **Simple interface:** The program runs on a terminal console, having a simple and easy to read interface.
- **Tecnologys:** Project made on the C language using libraries (besisdes the usual ones) such as <math.h>, <time.h>, <unistd.h> and <ctype.h>.
