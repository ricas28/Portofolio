# **Hello I'm Ricardo Santos!**
I'm currently studying Computer Science at [**Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico**](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) (Lisbon, Portugal). I created this repository to store all of my personal projects while I take my degree! Hope you enjoy :)

## **Skills**
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C, Risc-V Assembly, Prolog
- **Tools:** Git, Vs Code

## Projects
### **Tic-Tac-Toe game with miniMax algorithm**
#### **Description:**
This project implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe where the user can play against other player or a computer. The computer uses the miniMax algorithm to make the most optimal plays on a current game state. This project was made as my starting point in taking interest on logic and AI!
#### **Features**
- **Game Modes:** Play against other player or a computer. Computer Vs Computer mode was also implemented.
- **Artifical Intelligence:** The computer uses the miniMax algorithm to make the most optimal plays.
- **Simple interface:** The program runs on a terminal console, having a simple and easy to use interface.
- **Tecnologys:** Project made on the C language using libraries (besisdes the usual ones) such as <math.h>, <time.h>, <unistd.h> and <ctype.h>.
